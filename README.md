This repository contains the code for the VMP project, a clone of FiveM, with the following main features:

* [VMP](https://vmp.ir/), a dual-purpose (SP/MP) modification framework for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V as released by Rockstar Games.

* RedM-like support, a planned modification framework for other titles using similar concepts.

* FXServer-like functionality, providing server components for multiplayer services in the VMP project.

On the multiplayer aspect, the GTA/RAGE modifications differ from other similar projects by utilizing the embedded game networking frameworks, building a modification framework around them, and expanding the game's functionality on an end-to-end level, directly binding to the RAGE Technology Group's base frameworks and Rockstar North's GTA codebase.
